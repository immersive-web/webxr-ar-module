# WebXR Device API - Spatial Tracking
This document explains the technology and portion of the WebXR APIs used to track users' movement for a stable, comfortable, and predictable experience that works on the widest range of XR hardware. For context, it may be helpful to have first read about [WebXR Session Establishment](explainer.md), and [Input Mechanisms](input-explainer.md).

## Introduction
A big differentiating aspect of XR, as opposed to standard 3D rendering, is that users control the view of the experience via their body motion.  To make this possible, XR hardware needs to be capable of tracking the user's motion in 3D space.  Within the XR ecosystem there is a wide range of hardware form factors and capabilities which have historically only been available to developers through device-specific SDKs and app platforms. To ship software in a specific app store, developers optimize their experiences for specific VR hardware (HTC Vive, GearVR, Mirage Solo, etc) or AR hardware (HoloLens, ARKit, ARCore, etc).  WebXR  development is fundamentally different in that regard; the Web gives developers broader reach, with the consequence that they no longer have predictability about the capability of the hardware their experiences will be running on.

## Reference Spaces
The wide range of hardware form factors makes it impractical and unscalable to expect developers to reason directly about the tracking technology their experience will be running on.  Instead, the WebXR Device API is designed to have developers think upfront about the mobility needs of the experience they are building which is communicated to the User Agent by explicitly requesting an appropriate `XRReferenceSpace`.  The `XRReferenceSpace` object acts as a substrate for the XR experience being built by establishing guarantees about supported motion and providing a space in which developers can retrieve `XRViewerPose` and its view matrices.  The critical aspect to note is that the User Agent (or underlying platform) is responsible for providing consistently behaved lower-capability `XRReferenceSpace` objects even when running on a higher-capability tracking system. 

There are three types of reference spaces: `bounded`, `unbounded`, and `stationary`.  A bounded experience is one in which the user will move around their physical environment to fully interact, but will not need to travel beyond a fixed boundary defined by the XR hardware.  An unbounded experience is one in which a user is able to freely move around their physical environment and travel significant distances.  A stationary experience is one which does not require the user to move around in space, and includes "seated" or "standing" experiences.  Examples of each of these types of experiences can be found in the detailed sections below.

It is worth noting that not all experiences will work on all XR hardware and not all XR hardware will support all experiences (see [Appendix A: XRReferenceSpace Availability](#xrreferencespace-availability)).  For example, it is not possible to build a experience which requires the user to walk around on a device like a GearVR.  In the spirit of [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement), it is strongly recommended that developers select the least capable `XRReferenceSpace` that suffices for the experience they are building.  Requesting a more capable reference space will artificially restrict the set of XR devices their experience will otherwise be viewable from.

### Bounded Reference Space
A _bounded_ experience is one in which a user moves around their physical environment to fully interact, but will not need to travel beyond a pre-established boundary.  A _bounded_ experience is similar to a _unbounded_ experience in that both rely on XR hardware capable of tracking a users' locomotion.  However, _bounded_ experiences are explicitly focused on nearby content which allows them to target XR hardware that requires a pre-configured play area as well as XR hardware able to track location freely.

Some example use cases: 
* VR painting/sculpting tool
* Training simulators
* Dance games
* Previewing of 3D objects in the real world

The origin of this type will be initialized at a position on the floor for which a boundary can be provided to the app, defining an empty region where it is safe for the user to move around. The y value will be 0 at floor level, while the exact x, z, and orientation values will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform for room-scale experiences. Platforms where the user defines a fixed room-scale origin and boundary may initialize the remaining values to match the room-scale origin. Users with fixed-origin systems are familiar with this behavior, however developers may choose to be extra resilient to this situation by building UI to guide users back to the origin if they are too far away. Platforms that generally allow for unbounded movement may display UI to the user during the asynchronous request, asking them to define or confirm such a floor-level boundary near the user's current location.

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'bounded' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

The `XRBoundedReferenceSpace` also reports geometry within which the application should try to ensure that all content the user needs to interact with can be reached. This polygonal boundary represents a loop of points at the edges of the safe space. The points are given in a clockwise order as viewed from above, looking towards the negative end of the Y axis. The shape it describes is not guaranteed to be convex. The values reported are relative to the reference space origin, and must have a `y` value of `0` and a `w` value of `1`.

```js
// Demonstrated here using a fictional 3D library to simplify the example code.
function createBoundsMesh() {
  boundsMesh.clear();
  
  // Visualize the bounds geometry as 2 meter high quads
  let pointCount = xrReferenceSpace.boundsGeometry.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < pointCount - 1; ++i) {
    let pointA = xrReferenceSpace.boundsGeometry[i];
    let pointB = xrReferenceSpace.boundsGeometry[i+1];
    boundsMesh.addQuad(
        pointA.x, 0, pointA.z, // Quad Corner 1
        pointB.x, 2.0, pointB.z) // Quad Corner 2
  }
  // Close the loop
  let pointA = xrReferenceSpace.boundsGeometry[pointCount-1];
  let pointB = xrReferenceSpace.boundsGeometry[0];
  boundsMesh.addQuad(
        pointA.x, 0, pointA.z, // Quad Corner 1
        pointB.x, 2.0, pointB.z) // Quad Corner 2
  }
}
```

### Unbounded Reference Space
A _unbounded_ experience is one in which the user is able to freely move around their physical environment. These experiences explicitly require that the user be unbounded in their ability to walk around, and the unbounded reference space will adjust its origin as needed to maintain optimal stability for the user, even if the user walks many meters from the origin. In doing so, the origin may drift from its original physical location. The origin will be initialized at a position near the user's head at the time of creation. The exact `x`, `y`, `z`, and orientation values will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform for unbounded experiences.

Some example use cases: 
* Campus tour
* Renovation preview

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'unbounded' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

There is no mechanism for getting a floor-relative _unbounded_ reference space. This is because the user may move through a variety of elevations (via stairs, hills, etc), making identification of a single floor plane impossible.

### Stationary Reference Space
A _stationary_ experience is one which does not require the user to move around in space.  This includes several categories of experiences that developers are commonly building today.  "Standing" experiences can be created by passing the `floor-level` subtype.  "Seated" experiences can be created by passing the `eye-level` subtype.  Orientation-only experiences such as 360 photo/video viewers can be created by passing the `position-disabled` subtype.

It is important to note that `XRViewerPose` objects retrieved using the `floor-level` and `eye-level` subtypes may include position information as well as rotation information.  For example, hardware which does not support 6DOF tracking (ex: GearVR) may still use neck-modeling to improve user comfort. Similarly, a user may lean side-to-side on a device with 6DOF tracking (ex: HTC Vive).  It is important for user comfort that developers do not attempt to remove position data from these matrices and instead use the `position-disabled` subtype.  The result is that `floor-level` and `eye-level` experiences should be resilient to position changes despite not being dependent on receiving them.  

#### Floor-level Subtype

The origin of this subtype will be initialized at a position on the floor where it is safe for the user to engage in "standing-scale" experiences, with a `y` value of `0` at floor level. The exact `x`, `z`, and orientation values will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform for standing-scale experiences. Some platforms may initialize these values to the user's exact position/orientation at the time of creation. Other platforms may place this standing-scale origin at the user's chosen floor-level origin for bounded experiences. It is also worth noting that some XR hardware will be unable to determine the actual floor level and will instead use an emulated or estimated floor.

Some example use cases: 
* VR chat "room"
* Fallback for Bounded experience that relies on teleportation instead

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'stationary', subtype:'floor-level' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

#### Eye-level Subtype

Sometimes referred to as "seated", this subtype origin will be initialized at a position near the user's head at the time of creation. The exact `x`, `y`, `z`, and orientation values will be initialized based on the conventions of the underlying platform for stationary eye-level experiences. Some platforms may initialize these values to the user's exact position/orientation at the time of creation. Other platforms that allow users to reset a common eye-level origin shared across multiple apps may use that origin instead.

Some example use cases: 
* Immersive 2D video viewer
* Racing simulator
* Solar system explorer

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'stationary' , subtype:'eye-level' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

#### Position-disabled Subtype

The origin of this subtype will be initialized at a position near the user's head at the time of creation.  `XRViewerPose` objects retrieved with this subtype will have varying orientation values but will always report `x`, `y`, `z` values to be `0`.

Some example use cases: 
* 360 photo/video viewer

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'stationary', subtype:'position-disabled' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

### Identity reference spaces
An _identity_ reference space is one which provides no tracking. This type of reference space is used for creating inline experiences with tracking information explicitly disabled. Instead, developers use `XRReferenceSpace.originOffset` which is described in the [Application supplied transforms section](#application-supplied-transforms).  An example usage of an _identity_ reference space is a furniture viewer that will use [click-and-drag controls](#click-and-drag-view-controls) to rotate the furniture. It also supports cases where the developer wishes to avoid displaying any type of tracking consent prompt to the user prior while displaying inline content.

This type of reference space is requested with a type of `identity` and returns a basic `XRReferenceSpace`. `XRViewerPose` objects retrieved with this reference space will have a `transform` that is equal to the reference space's `originOffset` and the `XRView` matrices will be offset accordingly.

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

// Create an 'identity' reference space
function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace({ type:'identity' })
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

## Spatial relationships
One of the core features of any XR platform is its ability to track spatial relationships. Tracking the location of the viewer is perhaps the simplest example, but many other XR platform features, such as hit testing or anchors, are rooted in understanding the space the XR system is operating in. In WebXR any feature that tracks spatial relationships is built on top of the `XRSpace` interface. Each `XRSpace` represents something being tracked by the XR system, such as an `XRReferenceSpace`, and it is only possible to know their relative locations on a frame-by-frame basis.

### Coordinates in 3D Space

#### Rigid Transforms
When working with real-world spaces, it is important to be able to express transforms exclusively in terms of position and orientation. In WebXR this is done through the `XRRigidTransform` which contains a `position` vector and an `orientation` quaternion. When interpreting an `XRRigidTransform` the `orientation` is applied prior to the `position`. This means that, for example, a transform that indicates a quarter rotation to the right and a 1-meter translation along -Z would place a transformed object at `[0, 0, -1]` facing to the right. `XRRigidTransform`s also have a `matrix` attribute that reports the same transform as a 4×4 matrix when needed. By definition, the matrix of a rigid transform cannot contain scale or skew.

#### Poses
On a frame-by-frame basis, developers can query the location of any `XRSpace` relative to another `XRSpace` via the `XRFrame.getPose()` function. This function takes the `space` parameter which is the `XRSpace` to locate and the `relativeTo` parameter which defines the coordinate system in which the resulting `XRPose` should be returned. The `transform` attribute of `XRPose` is an `XRRigidTransform` representing the location of `space` within `relativeTo`. 

Developers should always check the result from `getPose()` as it will be null on frames in which `space`'s location cannot be determined within `relativeTo`. This may happen due to overall tracking loss, `space` or `relativeTo` not being locatable, or for other reasons. While the `relativeTo` parameter is an `XRSpace`, developers will often choose to supply a `XRReferenceSpace` as the `relativeTo` parameter so that coordinates will be consistent with those used for rendering. For more information on rendering, see the main [WebXR explainer](explainer.md). 

```js
  let pose = frame.getPose(xrSpace, xrReferenceSpace);
  if (pose) {
    // Do a thing
  }
```

The `emulatedPosition` attribute of `XRPose` indicates that the translation components of retrieved pose matrices may not be accurate. There are a number of reasons this might be the case. For example, a headset with orientation-only tracking capability may include position data to represent neck modeling. Another reason might be the underlying platform's tracking-loss behavior causes orientation data to be updated while it is unable to update position data. In these situations, the `emulatedPosition` attribute will be set to `true`.

#### Rays
An `XRRay` object includes both an `origin` and `direction`, both given as `DOMPointReadOnly`s. The `origin` represents a 3D coordinate in space with a `w` component that must be 1, and the `direction` represents a normalized 3D directional vector with a `w` component that must be 0. The `XRRay` also defines a `matrix` which represents the transform from a ray originating at `[0, 0, 0]` and extending down the negative Z axis to the ray described by the `XRRay`'s `origin` and `direction`. This is useful for positioning graphical representations of the ray.

### Viewer space
Calls to `XRFrame.getViewerPose()` return an `XRViewerPose` object which contains the pose of the viewer along with the views to be rendered. Sometimes it is useful to have access to the `XRSpace` represented by the viewer directly, such when the developer wants to use it to compare locations against other `XRSpace` objects.

```js
  let pose = xrFrame.getPose(preferredInputSource.gripSpace, xrSession.viewerSpace);
  if (pose) {
    // Calculate how far the motion controller is from the user's head
  }
```

### Application-supplied transforms
Frequently developers will want to provide an additional, artificial transform on top of the user's tracked motion to allow the user to navigate larger virtual scenes than their tracking systems or physical space allows. This effect is traditionally accomplished by mathematically combining the API-provided transform with the desired additional application transforms. WebXR offers developers a simplification to ensure that all tracked values, such as viewer and input poses, are transformed consistently.

Developers can specify application-specific transforms by setting the `originOffset` attribute of any `XRReferenceSpace`. The `originOffset` is initialized to an identity transform, and any values queried using the `XRReferenceSpace` will be offset by the `position` and `orientation` the `originOffset` describes. The `XRReferenceSpace`'s `originOffset` can be updated at any time and will immediately take effect, meaning that any subsequent poses queried with the `XRReferenceSpace` will take into account the new `originOffset`. Previously queried values will not be altered. Changing the `originOffset` between pose queries in a single frame is not advised, since it will cause inconsistencies in the tracking data and rendered output.

A common use case for this attribute would be for a "teleportation" mechanic, where the user "jumps" to a new point in the virtual scene, after which the selected point is treated as the new virtual origin which all tracked motion is relative to.

```js
// Teleport the user a certain number of meters along the X, Y, and Z axes
function teleport(deltaX, deltaY, deltaZ) {
  let currentOrigin = xrReferenceSpace.originOffset;
  xrReferenceSpace.originOffset = new XRRigidTransform(
      { x: currentOrigin.position.x + deltaX,
        y: currentOrigin.position.y + deltaY,
        z: currentOrigin.position.z + deltaZ },
      currentOrigin.orientation);
}
```

### Relating between reference spaces
There are several circumstances in which developers may choose to relate content in different reference spaces.

#### Inline to Immersive
It is expected that developers will often choose to preview `immersive` experiences with a similar experience `inline`. In this situation, users often expect to see the scene from the same perspective when they make the transition from `inline` to `immersive`. To accomplish this, developers should grab the `transform` of the last `XRViewerPose` retrieved using the `inline` session's `XRReferenceSpace` and set it as the `originOffset` of the `immersive` session's `XRReferenceSpace`. The same logic applies in the reverse when exiting `immersive`.

#### Unbounded to Bounded 
When building an experience that is predominantly based on an `XRUnboundedReferenceSpace`, developers may occasionally choose to switch to an `XRBoundedReferenceSpace`.  For example, a whole-home renovation experience might choose to switch to a bounded reference space for reviewing a furniture selection library.  If necessary to continue displaying content belonging to the previous reference space, developers may call the `XRFrame`'s `getPose()` method to re-parent nearby virtual content to the new reference space.

### Click-and-drag view controls
Frequently with inline sessions it's desirable to have the view rotate when the user interacts with the inline canvas. This is useful on devices without tracking capabilities to allow users to still view the full scene, but can also be desirable on devices with some tracking capabilities, such as a mobile phone or tablet, as a way to adjust the users view without requiring them to physically turn around.

By updating the `originOffset` in response to pointer events, pages can provide basic click-and-drag style controls to allow the user to pan the view around the immersive scene.

```js
// Amount to rotate, in radians, per CSS pixel of pointer movement.
const RAD_PER_PIXEL = Math.PI / 180.0; // (1 degree)

// Pan the view any time pointer move events happen over the canvas.
function onPointerMove(event) {
  let s = Math.sin(event.movementX * RAD_PER_PIXEL);
  let c = Math.cos(event.movementX * RAD_PER_PIXEL);
  let o = xrReferenceSpace.originOffset.orientation;

  xrReferenceSpace.originOffset = new XRRigidTransform(
      // Keep the previous position
      xrReferenceSpace.originOffset.position,
      // Quaternion math to rotate the previous orientation around the Y axis.
      {
        x: o.x * c - o.z * s,
        y: o.y * c + o.w * s,
        z: o.z * c + o.x * s,
        w: o.w * c - o.y * s
      });
}
inlineCanvas.addEventListener('pointermove', onPointerMove);
```

## Practical-usage guidelines

### Inline sessions
Inline sessions, by definition, do not require a user gesture or user permission to create, and as a result there must be strong limitations on the pose data that can be reported for privacy and security reasons. Requests for `identity` reference spaces will always succeed. Requests for an `XRBoundedReferenceSpace` or an `XRUnboundedReferenceSpace` will always be rejected on inline sessions. Requests for an `XRStationaryReferenceSpace` may succeed but may also be rejected if the UA is unable provide any tracking information such as for an inline session on a desktop PC or a 2D browser window in a headset. The UA is also allowed to request the user's consent prior to returning an `XRStationaryReferenceSpace`.

### Ensuring hardware compatibility
Immersive sessions will always be able to provide a `XRStationaryReferenceSpace`, but may not support other `XRReferenceSpace` types due to hardware limitations.  Developers are strongly encouraged to follow the spirit of [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) and provide a reasonable fallback behavior if their desired `XRBoundedReferenceSpace` or `XRUnboundedReferenceSpace` is unavailable.  In many cases it will be adequate for this fallback to behave similarly to an inline preview experience.

```js
let xrSession = null;
let xrReferenceSpace = null;

function onSessionStarted(session) {
  xrSession = session;
  xrSession.requestReferenceSpace([
    { type:'unbounded' }, 
    { type:'stationary', subtype:'eye-level' }
  ])
  .then((referenceSpace) => {
    xrReferenceSpace = referenceSpace;
    if (xrReferenceSpace instanceof XRUnboundedReferenceSpace) {
      // Set up unbounded experience
    } else if (xrReferenceSpace instanceof XRStationaryReferenceSpace) {
      // Build an appropriate fallback experience if needed; perhaps similar to the inline version
    }
  })
  .then(setupWebGLLayer)
  .then(() => {
    xrSession.requestAnimationFrame(onDrawFrame);
  });
}
```

While many sites will be able to provide this fallback, for some sites this will not be possible.  Under these circumstances, it is instead preferable for session creation to reject rather than spin up immersive display/tracking systems only to immediately exit the session.

```js
function beginImmersiveSession() {
  xrDevice.requestSession({ immersive: true,  requiredReferenceSpaceType:'unbounded' })
      .then(onSessionStarted)
      .catch(err => {
        // Error will indicate required reference space type unavailable
      });
}
```

### Floor Alignment
Some XR hardware with inside-out tracking has users establish "known spaces" that can be used to easily provide `XRBoundedReferenceSpace` and the `floor-level` subtype of `XRStationaryReferenceSpace`.  On inside-out XR hardware which does not intrinsically provide these known spaces, the User Agent must still provide `XRStationaryReferenceSpace` of subtype `floor-level`.  It may do so by estimating a floor level, but may not present any UI at the time the reference space is requested.  

Additionally, XR hardware with orientation-only tracking may also provide an emulated value for the floor offset of an `XRStationaryReferenceSpace` with the `floor-level` subtype.  On these devices, it is recommended that the User Agent or underlying platform provide a setting for users to customize this value.

### Reset Event
The `XRReferenceSpace` type has an event, `onreset`, that is fired when a discontinuity of the reference space's origin occurs.  This discontinuity may be caused for different reasons for each type, but the result is essentially the same, the perception of the user's location will have changed.  In response, pages may wish to reposition virtual elements in the scene or clear any additional transforms, such as teleportation transforms, that may no longer be needed.  The `onreset` event will fire prior to any poses being delivered with the new origin/direction, and all poses queried following the event must be relative to the reset origin/direction. 

```js
xrReferenceSpace.addEventListener('reset', xrReferenceSpaceEvent => {
  // Check for the transformation between the previous origin and the current origin
  // This will not always be available, but if it is, developers may choose to use it
  let transform = xrReferenceSpaceEvent.transform;

  // For an app that allows artificial Yaw rotation, this would be a perfect
  // time to reset that.
  resetYawTransform(transform);

  // For an app using the XRBoundedReferenceSpace, this would be a perfect time to
  // re-layout content intended to be reachable within the bounds
  createBoundsMesh(transform);
});
```

Example reasons `onreset` may fire:
* Some XR systems have a mechanism for allowing the user to reset which direction is "forward" or re-center the scene's origin at their current location.
* When a user steps outside the bounds of a "known" playspace and enters a different "known" playspace
* An inside-out based tracking system is temporarily unable to locate the user (ex: due to poor lighting conditions) and is unable to relate the new map fragment to the previous map fragment when it recovers
* When the user has travelled far enough from the origin of an `XRUnboundedReferenceSpace` that floating point error would become problematic

The `onreset` event will **NOT** fire as an `XRUnboundedReferenceSpace` makes small changes to its origin as part of maintaining space stability near the user; these are considered minor corrections rather than a discontinuity in the origin.

## Appendix A : Miscellaneous

### Tracking Systems Overview
In the context of XR, the term _tracking system_ refers to the technology by which an XR device is able to determine a user's motion in 3D space.  There is a wide variance in the capability of tracking systems.

**Orientation-only** tracking systems typically use accelerometers to determine the yaw, pitch, and roll of a user's head.  This is often paired with a technique known as _neck-modeling_ that adds simulated position changes based on an estimation of the orientation changes originating from a point aligned with a simulated neck position.

**Outside-in** tracking systems involve setting up external sensors (i.e. sensors not built into the HMD) to locate a user in 3D space.  These sensors form a bounded area in which the user can reasonably expect be tracked.

**Inside-out** tracking systems typically use cameras and computer vision technology to locate a user in 3D space.  This same technique is also used to "lock" virtual content at specific physical locations.
