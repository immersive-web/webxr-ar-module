# WebXR Augmented Reality Module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module)

The [WebXR Augmented Reality Module][21] extends the WebXR Device API to expose the ability to create a basic augmented reality (AR) session. This module is a product of the [Immersive Web Working Group][17].

## Taking Part

1. Read the [code of conduct][18]
2. See if your issue is being discussed in the [issues][21], or if your idea is being discussed in the [proposals repo][19].
3. We will be publishing the minutes from working group's bi-weekly calls.
4. You can also join the working group to participate in these discussions.

## Specifications
This repo is for the design of the [WebXR Augmented Reality Module][21] which extends the WebXR Device API to allow developers to create basic augmented reality sessions on compatible XR hardware.

## Maintainers

To generate the spec document (`index.html`) from the `index.bs` [Bikeshed][10] document:

```sh
make
```


## Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests][11] PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue][12]
to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.
